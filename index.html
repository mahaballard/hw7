<h1>Homework 7: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map </h1>
<h3>In this assignment, I chose to create a choropleth and symbol map of the current voter registration status in Colorada
    as of February 1st, 2022. I chose this topic because there are several local and state elections that will take place
    in the next couple months and I wanted to see how many people are registered and their status whether they are active, inactive or 
    preregistered to vote!
